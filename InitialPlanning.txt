Database holding users, their accounts, transfers, transfer types/statuses

accounts table holds balance

need to make  JdbcAccountDao, JdbcTransferDao (access status and type)

create controllers for AccountController getBalance
TransferController (requesting, sending)


General Notes:
for every transfer of money, 2 transfers are created. A recieved and sent



JdbcAccountDao:
	getAccounts (by userID) return list
	getBalance (by accountID) return BD
	addToBalance (by accountID) return boolean
	subtractFromBalance (by accountID) return boolean

JdbcTransferDao:
	getTransferById
		look for transfer id and current user id
	listAllTransfersByAccountID (byAccountID)
		list to and from transfers based on accountID
		Need to list all transfers user is associated with, find other user in the transfer to display their name 
	getTransferInfo (by User and ID)
	transfer(senderId, recieverID, amount)
		compare amount to senders balance

		
JdbcTransferStatusDao
	Every time new transfer done, use that transfer id and create new status

JdbcTransferTypeDao
	Every time new transfer done, use that transfer id and create 2 new types, sent and recieved



AccountController:
	getBalance
	listUsers


TransferController:
	sendTransfer (for now this is just sending)
		talk to accountDao to do the adding and subtracting
	acceptTransfer (for optional)
	listTranfersByAccountID
	getTransferDetailsByTransferID
